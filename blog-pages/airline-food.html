  <h1>Should Youtube get a free pass?</h1>
  <p>All the news is focusing on Facebook lately and for good reason. Their reputation has been shaky for a while now, but the recent iOS 14 privacy changes have really shown a light to the average consumer that Facebook's data collection is far too invasive. And that's not the only reason people are mad, everyone's Uncle is now an extreme Q-anon believer thanks to Facebook too. Twitter's also received its fair share of backlash for allowing alt-right conspiracies to run rampant. Although to be fair, they actually do try and moderate those as quickly as possible and even banned the superspreader of misinformation, 45 himself.
    </p>
<p>
The platform nobody's talking about however, is Youtube. As per this brilliant NYT article from 2019, it's apparent that people are missing an elephant in the room. The Youtube algorithm is just as dangerous as Facebook and Twitter's, but possibly even worse due to the video nature of the platform. I'm sure most people remember "Plandemic" the viral video claiming Coronavirus was a hoax from early last year. That video spread on Facebook, but it revealed a gaping hole in the way Youtube allows conspiracy videos to exist on the platform. They don't pay attention to what is being uploaded until it's too late. It's even worse when you see that Plandemic's high production value, as iit gives the appearance of legitimacy, thus allowing it to spread further as "the truth". The video uses documentary-style propaganda to push viewers into believing that it's true and that's proof of how these platforms can be gamed for nefarious purposes.

I've worked in the publishing industry for a few years now and while tech has rapidly changed the publishing landscape, I think in some ways the tech industry has a lot to learn from publishing. One of the smartest decisions I've ever seen in the world of tech was when Apple announced that they'd use real editors to curate their Apple News platform. I immediately knew it'd be a bad financial decision, but Apple is big enough to sell a service at a loss if it leads to new iPhone users. The world of algorithm curation runs into the natural limitations of machine learning. A common machine learning joke you'll see online is this:
</p>
<p>
"concerned parent: if all your friends jumped off a bridge would you follow them?
<br>
machine learning algorithm: yes."
</p>
<p>
And it's true, the algorithm will give you more of what engages users instead of finding them content that will really help them. This is why real editors always lose in the war against algorithm creation, because editors are human and can't force-feed users articles the way an algorithm can.
</p>
<p>The recent documentary "The Social Dilemma" paints a dark picture of the algorithm, showing it would lead to violence. At the time I thought this a bit extreme. Documentaries use propaganda, scare tactics, high budgets, etc. to make their case. But after seeing the Capitol Riot, I think people should be more wary of any algorithm-based platform going forward.
</p>

<p>In publishing, we scrutinize the content, make sure it's high quality and have transparent standards that will help the world. I'm not saying we should stop allowing people to upload videos, we simply need to vet for actively harmful videos and to curate with more a human touch. Tech refuses to uses these models because paying for editors and moderators is expensive. It's a short-sighted decision because the damage these algorithms are doing to the reputations of these companies is unrepairable. People aren't going to have faith in a platform that is associated with conspiracy theorists.</p>
